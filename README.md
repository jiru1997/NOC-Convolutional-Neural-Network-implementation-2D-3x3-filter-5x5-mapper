NOC Convolutional Neural Network implementation by using systemverilog

In this project, we built four CNNs to take the knowledge we learned from classes and papers into practice. Based on the modules we built for homeworks, we implemented the basic network by which we can fetch data from a .txt file, perform convolution calculations, compare the final result with the golden result and report the errors. We also achieved some enhancements like 2D PEs arrays, convolutional layers and data pooling. By doing this project, we learned the basic calculation mechanism of machine learning, and enhanced our skills of using SystemVerilog and teamwork.

In this part, the input filter is a 2D 3x3 matrix and the input mapper is a 5x5 matrix

You can use QuestaSim to build and run this project.
